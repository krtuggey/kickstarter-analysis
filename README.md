# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This project worked with data from a multitude of kickstarter campaigns, including their goals, pledges, countries and types of kickstarter. The focus is on plays and musicals for a potentiel client who is interested in the Great Britian and United States sections of the kickstarter campaigns. This analysis uncovers what would be the appropriate goals to set for a successful kickstarter campaign as well as other statistical information so that the client understands the data story.

Here are the visualizations created during the analysis:

Based off of the analysis of the kickstarter data, I would recommend that the client create a goal set around $4000.00, the mean of successful musicals in Great Britain. Larger financial goals set for musicals have shown to be a contributing factor in the campaign failure. Campaigns started in the summer time, specifically May and June have shown to be more successful, so a summer campaign start would be wise.
